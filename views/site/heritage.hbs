        Women have been crucified and vilified for centuries. From witch hunts to slut shaming, the sacred nature of womanhood has been slain, to the detriment of all.
    </p>
    <p class="baja-font-larger">
        I believe there exists the creatrix and healer in every woman. We hold incredible power.
    </p>
    <p class="baja-font-larger">
        Attempts to assassinate our character, to objectify us, to domesticate our wild nature, seem like an eternal threat.

        In the West, the word ‘witch’ has an immediate negative connotation for most. It is associated with wickedness and black magic. The word is used as a derogative, to shame and diminish women.

        In Spanish, the word ‘bruja’ (pronounced broo-ha) has a more mystical and shamanic association. A woman whom is deeply connected to herself, and the world around her. A practitioner of natural medicine. Although also used to disempower and denigrate, my experience of the word has been that of mystery and intrigue.

    <p class="baja-font-larger"> ‘Baja La Bruja’ translates to ‘Lower The Witch!’ </p>

    <p class="baja-font-larger">A command to the world to release women from the metaphorical stake, to which we are violently bound. An invitation to revere and celebrate us, rather than to shame and discriminate against us.  </p>
    <p class="baja-font-larger">May we, as women, remember the divine nature of our being and the important role we play as nurturer to ourselves, each other and to the earth. We are connected through a global sisterhood and can strive to support one another through sharing and community. I encourage all women to embrace the inherent beauty of their sacred femininity. </p>
